          Google is set to build a new subsea cable connecting Chile with
          Australia, via French Polynesia — the first such cable to directly
          connect South America with Asia-Pacific. Dubbed “Humboldt,” after
          German polymath and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, the new cable is
          the latest in more than a dozen similar subsea cables that Google has
          invested in over the past 15 years, a journey that kicked off in 2010
          with Unity that stretched some 6,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean
          from California to Japan. While countless other submarine cables
          traverse the Pacific Ocean, they substantively connect Asia with North
          America, though some do snake down the Pacific coast from the U.S and
          Mexico to various landing points in the South of the continent.
          Indeed, Google completed its first entirely private cable project four
          years ago with Curie, connecting California with Chile. GGoogle hasn’t
          given any indication as to when Humboldt will be complete, but rather
          than going it alone as it has done with other recent cable projects,
          the internet giant is partnering with Chile’s Desarrollo País and
          Office des postes et télécommunications de Polynésie française (OPT)
          to lay the 9,200 mile (14,800 KM) cable. As with its other similar
          endeavors, Humboldt is designed to improve data transfers around the
          world, working in tandem with Google’s other infrastructure projects,
          including local data centers on the ground in Chile — it’s all about
          promising its customers lower-latency, while the countries themselves
          benefit from a more robust internet infrastructure. Tech companies
          including Meta, Microsoft and Amazon have also invested in various
          internet infrastructure programs, and alongside Google the quartet are
          said to either own or lease around half of all subsea cabling
          bandwidth. oogle hasn’t given any indication as to when Humboldt will
